      <!-- Unique, SEO-friendly article derived from the provided transcript (keeps voice but rewritten for uniqueness) -->
      <p>On September 9th, Toca Boca World released an expansive new <strong>free Family House</strong>, and it’s packed with surprises. The two-story layout is generous — it comes with two walls, two floors, a balcony and a charming front yard — and Toca made sure players have useful free items to style it immediately: curtains, a rug, lighting, a lawn mower and a sprinkler pro.</p>

      <p>Because the house is available for free, it’s an excellent base for players who don’t own additional packs. That said, any paid furniture or themed packs you already have will let you transform the space further. For example, the upcoming <em>Welcome Home Furniture Pack</em> (a paid pack releasing alongside the house) adds curated pieces that sit beautifully inside the new rooms — and I’ll publish a full review of that pack soon.</p>

      <p>The front yard is surprisingly versatile: use it as a small patio, a kids’ play area, or a pet corner. The included lawn mower actually animates and trims the grass, while the sprinkler adds a touch of playful interaction — perfect for role-play scenes. The sideyard is a neat spot for a hammock or a tiny lounge; I could imagine a kid’s sandbox or a cozy outdoor seating area there.</p>

      <h2>Interior highlights</h2>
      <p>The first floor is roomy and lends itself to a standout kitchen and an entryway with grass styling. An elevator connects both floors — a nice touch for family role-play. Upstairs, there’s a large master suite with a bay-window shelf (great for plants or decor), a nursery-sized space suitable for babies, and a playroom that easily fits a bunk bed and an arts & crafts table. There’s also room for a teen bedroom that could double as a study, workout room, or even a small sauna if you’re feeling creative.</p>

      <h2>Customization tips — all free</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Swap wallpapers using free patterns to match your chosen aesthetic (I paired green and pink floral wallpaper with exposed brick for a cozy look).</li>
        <li>Use the balcony as a small reading nook or a rooftop garden.</li>
        <li>Create themed rooms using only free gifts earned from the weekly freebies system.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Want to go further? If you own paid packs, place those items to bring character and function to rooms — the Welcome Home Furniture Pack is an ideal complement and will be featured in a follow-up makeover video.</p>

      <h2>Ideas from the community</h2>
      <p>Readers suggested patios, pet play zones, and game areas in the backyard — all viable and fun options. If you share your design idea and I try it in a video, I’ll give a shout-out in the description.</p>

      <p>Finally, this house proves that great role-play doesn’t require purchases. With a little creativity, the free Family House is a huge, flexible space that will make many players very happy. Let me know your ideas for the sideyard or backyard and I might feature them in the next makeover.</p>
